OPCache Dashboard
=================
Set up properly and monitor your Zend OPCache with this dashboard.
Check memory, hits, status, configuration, diagnostic and reset scripts.

Installation
============
Just copy and paste ```opcache.php``` anywhere in your public folder. Try to keep it safe for non authorized users.

Next steps
==========
I will be adding information to help to set up your opcache in your server so you don't need to read about posts around
about how to do it.
